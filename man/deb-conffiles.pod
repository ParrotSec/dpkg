=head1 NAME

deb-conffiles - package conffiles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<DEBIAN/conffiles>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A package declares its list of conffiles by including a I<conffiles> file
in its control archive (i.e. I<DEBIAN/conffiles> during package creation).

This file contains a list of files, one per line.
They should be listed as absolute pathnames, and should exist in the binary
package, otherwise B<dpkg>(1) will ignore them (although by default
B<dpkg-deb>(1) will refuse to build such binary packages).
Trailing whitespace will be trimmed, and empty lines will be ignored.
